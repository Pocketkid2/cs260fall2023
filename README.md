# Start-up: Film Hub

## Elevator Pitch

The one-stop shop for film nerds. You can find information about movies, read reviews, and even contribute your own reviews and chat with other users. You can also keep track of your favorite films, films you've watched, and films you want to see. The site will be connected to other useful sites such as Wikipedia, IMDB, RottenTomatoes, and Blu-ray.com.
