# Film Hub

## Elevator Pitch

The one-stop shop for film nerds. You can chat with other users, read their film scores and reviews, and share your own. But this site isn't self-contained, it pulls data from other popular sites such as IMDB, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, and Blu-ray.com for additional reviews and information.
