### Assignment: GitHub w/ merge conflict

Merging happens when you have two divergent branches, such as when GitHub repo is changed and committed online (remote) and the local repo is also changed and committed, and you want to do a push or pull. The easy solution is to only perform work on one repo, or to perform a merge.

### Assignment: Amazon Web Services EC2

Elastic IP: 3.214.253.236 

### Assignment: HTML Structure Elements

You can put the full size image URL, and then use just width or height to resize it properly

### Simon CSS

The Simon CSS code that I published to my server tells the webpage to not display the header and footer if the height gets smaller than a threshold. I want to do something similar with my startup so that if the width gets smaller than a threshold, the header and footer size shrink as a function of width as opposed to being a constant size like they currently are.
